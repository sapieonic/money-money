# Money Tracker - Frontend

A React-based web application for tracking personal finances including income, expenses, investments (SIPs), and assets.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material UI (MUI)** for UI components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Firebase** for authentication (Google Sign-in)
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Axios** for API communication
- **Vite** for build tooling

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project with Google Auth enabled
- Backend API running (see `../manager`)

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### 3. Get Firebase Credentials

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Go to Project Settings > General
4. Scroll down to "Your apps" and click "Add app" > Web
5. Copy the config values to your `.env` file
6. Enable Google Sign-in under Authentication > Sign-in method

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```
